# Prediction-with-denoising

This project is a demonstration of how denoising can improve the accuracy of predictive models.
The main objective of the project is to provide a simple and easily understandable implementation of denoising with kalman filter in the context of predictive modeling.

# Requirements

To run the project, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

1. Python 3.x
2. NumPy
3. Matplotlib
4. Scikit-learn
All library that you need is imported in the file

# Getting Started

To use the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
3. Run the PredictionWithDenoising.ipynb file.

# Usage

The project consists of two main parts:

PredictionWithDenoising.ipynb: contains the implementation of the denoising algorithm.
Nikkei.csv file that contains of data.
